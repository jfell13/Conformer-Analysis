The conf-subs.py will create a .xyz file from each conformer .pdb, and then for each .xyz a Gaussian16 input and submission file will be made.
The script will then auto-submit these jobs. Depending on the size of your molecule these optimizations can take a whole 24 hours to complete. 

Options include:
-t Theory [ex: B3lYP, M06, B97, etc. (Default: B3LYP)] 
-b Basis set [ex: 6-31G(d), 6-311+G(d,p), etc. (Default: 6-311G(d,p)]
-d Dispersion corrections [ex: GD2, GD3, or GD3BJ (Default: none)]
-s Solvation corrections [ex: ethanol, chcl3, ch2cl2, or water (Default: none)]
-c Charge [ex: -1, 0, +2 (Default: 0)]

After Gaussian is completed, then use confs-analysis.py. This script will iterate through each output file (.log) and parse for different
values to piece together for a relatively accurate free energy value (a quasi harmonic corrected Gibbs free energy; aka qG). After calculating
the qG for each .log, the script generates energies.txt which contains the conformer name, qG and the delta-qG based upon the lowest energy
conformer, and it is ordered from lowest to highest. After this step the script then takes the conformers that are within 3 kcal mol if the
lowest energy conformer and create a .confs.pdb file with all these low energy conformers. This script also allows you to name the final
conformer file.
